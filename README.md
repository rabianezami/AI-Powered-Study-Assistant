# AI-Powered Study Assistant

Hi there! 👋  
This is a **Python-based AI Study Assistant** that dynamically generates questions, evaluates your answers, and adapts the difficulty based on your performance.  

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Question Generation:** Multiple questions per topic with difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).  
- **Answer Evaluation:** Automatically checks your answer and tracks your correct/wrong streak.  
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** If you answer 3 questions correctly → difficulty increases, if 2 wrong → difficulty decreases.  
- **Feedback Agent:** Tracks performance automatically, so the system learns your pace.  
- **Session-Based Memory:** Remembers which questions you've seen to avoid repetition.
